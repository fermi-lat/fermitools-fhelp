NAME

    gtptest - Applies statistical tests to a series of pulse phase
              values stored in given event file(s).

USAGE

    gtptest evfile outfile numphase numharm maxharm

DESCRIPTION

    This tool applies all the statistical tests available with
    gtpsearch application to a series of pulse phase values stored in
    given event files.  The tool supports several test statistics
    available, including Chi-squared (X2), Z-squared-n ( Z2N), H, and
    Rayleigh (Z2N with N == 1).

PARAMETERS

evfile [file name]
    Name of input event file, FT1 format or equivalent.

outfile [file name]
    Name of output FITS file that contains a search result.  If
    outfile is NONE, no FITS output will be created.

numphase = 10 [integer]
    Number of phase bins in each trial for the chi-squared test. 
    This parameter only has effect if algorithm is CHI2.

numharm = 10 [integer]
    Number of harmonics in each trial for the Z2n/Rayleigh test. 
    This parameter only has effect if algorithm is Z2N.  For the
    Rayleigh test, set algorithm to Z2N, and set numharm to 1.

maxharm = 10 [integer]
    Maximum number of harmonics in each trial for the H test.  This
    parameter only has effect if algorithm is H.

(evtable = EVENTS) [string]
    Name of the FITS table containing the event data.

(pphasefield = PULSE_PHASE) [string]
    Name of the output column to contain the assigned pulse phase.

(plot = yes) [bool]
    If plot is yes, the result will be displayed in a separate plot
    window, as well as the numerical results will be output in a text
    screen.  If plot is no, only the text output will be displayed,
    and no plot window will be displayed.

(title = DEFAULT) [string]
    Title for the graph. By default a title indicating the type of
    test and other pertinent information will be displayed.

(chatter = 2) [integer, min=0, max=4]
    This parameter fixes the output verbosity: no screen output (0),
    nominal screen output (2), maximum verbosity (4).

(clobber = yes) [boolean]
    Overwrite or do not overwrite existing output files.

(debug = no) [boolean]
    Activate debugging mode. When debug is "no", all exceptions that
    are not caught and handled by individual tool-specific code are
    caught by a top-level exception handler that displays information
    about the exception and then exits. When debug is "yes", such
    exceptions are not caught by the top level code. Instead the tool
    produces a segmentation violation, which is more useful for
    debugging. When debugging mode is enabled, the tool produces more
    verbose output describing any errors or exceptions that are
    encountered.

(gui = no) [boolean]
    Graphical user Interface (GUI) mode activated if "yes" is
    specified.

(mode = ql) [string]
    Mode of automatic parameters.

EXAMPLES

    The example below shows how to perform periodicity tests on an
    event file that has been processed by gtpphase application, where
    a pulse phase has already been assigned to each photon and is
    stored in a default FITS column (PULSE_PHASE column).

        > gtptest evfile=fakepulsar_event_phase.fits \
            outfile=gtptest_example_1.fits numphase=10 numharm=10 maxharm=10

    This command produces an output message that describes the types
    and the parameters of the periodicity tests that are performed,
    and explains the test results.  A plot will also be produced,
    which shows a folded-light curve used in the chi-squared test.

KNOWN BUGS

    When running gtpsearch multiple times using the GUI, plot windows
    from previous runs reappear after they are closed manually. Thus,
    there is no way to permanently close plot windows without exiting
    the GUI.
