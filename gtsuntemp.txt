NAME
     gtsuntemp - Generates the average intensity skymaps as a function
	of energy for the Sun or the Moon. The output fits file can be
	used in likelihood analysis in a similar fashion as the
	diffuse emission model.

DESCRIPTION

    This tool takes the standard exposure map used for normal analysis, the 
    exposure map from gthpexpsun and a profile of the intensity of the Moon or 
    the Sun as a function of angle from the Sun or the Moon and energy. The only
    profile format currently supported is a FITS file with extensions named: 
    ANGLES, ENERGIES, SST_PROFILE. The parameters controlling the binning of the
    final template are identical to those of gtexpcube2. The tool works by first
    calculating the expected photons sr-1 MeV-1 from the moving source using the
    angular binned exposure map and the input profile. This is then turned into 
    average intensity by dividing with the normal exposure map. If the energy 
    binning of the solar profile does not match that of the output map a 
    power-law interpolation is used.


NOTES

    The template of the moving source must be generated using the same events 
    file and livetime cube used in the analysis. Different cuts generate 
    different templates.

    At present, models used for the solar and lunar emission are fixed for any
    period of solar activity.

    The energy binning for gtexpcube2, gtexphpsun, and gtsuntemp must match or 
    the tools will fail with an error message saying that some energy bins are 
    not found.

PARAMETERS
	
     expsun [filename] 
     Exposure map from gtexphpsun binned in healpix and solar angles.

     avgexp [filename] 
     Binned xposure map from gtexpcube2.

     sunprof [filename] 
     Profile of the intensity of the moving source for the moon and the sun 
     (e.g., lunar_profile_v2r0.fits and solar_profile_v2r0.fits).  The tool 
     expects fits files with the following tables: ANGLES listing the angles 
     used in the profile (center values), ENERGIES listing the energies in the 
     profile, and SST_PROFILE listing the intensity as a function of energy and
     distance from the source.  The SST_PROFILE should be a vector table where 
     each row gives the spectrum of the emission for a given distance.

     cmap [filename]
     Counts map file from gtbin, for which gtsuntemp should match the 
     coordinate projection and gridding.  Select "none" if the map geometry is 
     specified from parameters (nxpix, nypix, xref, yref, enumbins, etc). 

     outfile [filename] 
     Average intensity skymaps.

     nxpix [integer]
     Size of the X (i.e., horizontal) axis in pixels. If proj is "CAR", "AIT", 
     or "ZEA", the value "1" is used for full sky.

     nypix [integer]
     Size of the Y (i.e., vertical) axis in pixels. If proj is "CAR", "AIT", or 
     "ZEA", the value "1" is used for full sky.	 

     binsz [double]
     The number of degrees per pixel at the center of the image.

     coordsys [boolean]
     Coordinate system. If you choose CEL you will be prompted for ra and dec 
     (J2000), if you choose GAL you will be prompted for l and b coordinates. 

     xref [double]
     The horizontal position of the center of the image, either RA in celestial 
     coordinates or l in galactic coordinates. 	

     yref [double]
     The vertical position of the center of the image, either DEC in celestial c
     oordinates or b in galactic coordinates. 

     axisrot [double]
     The rotation angle desired for the image. 

     proj [string]
     The allowed values are: AIT, ZEA, ARC, CAR, GLS, MER, NCP, SIN, STG, TAN 
     or any other three letter identifier recognized by wcslib (see Calabretta 
     & Greisen 2002, A&A, 395, 1077 for definitions of the projections).  Must 
     be AIT, ZEA, or CAR for auto full sky. 

     (ebinalg = LOG) [string]
     Indicates how the energy bins will be specified. Legal values are FILE 
     (bin boundaries will be read from a bin definition file) or LOG 
     (logarithmically uniform bins).   

     emin [double]
     The lowest energy of the first interval for linearly or logarithmically 
     uniform bins. Only used if ebinalg is LOG.

     emax [double]
     The highest energy of the last interval for linearly or logarithmically 
     uniform bins. Only used if ebinalg is LOG.

     enumbins [integer]
     The number of bins for logarithmically uniform bins. Only used if ebinalg 
     is LOG. 

     ebinfile [filename]
     The name of the energy bin definition file. Only used if ebinalg is FILE.

     (bincalc = EDGE) [string]
     Allows to choose how energy layers are computed from the count map (cmap 
     parameter) energy bounds, e.g., bincalc="CENTER" will force the tool to 
     compute the exposures using the energy at the geometric mean of the energy 
     bounds for each energy bin. The default is bincalc="EDGE" and should be 
     what is used in the binned Likelihood analysis. It must be the same as the
     one used in the gtexpcube2

     irfs [string]
     Instrument response functions. The instrument response (PSF, effective
     area, energy resolution) is currently a function of energy, inclination 
     angle (the angle between the source and the LAT normal) and photon 
     category. The default value is the lastest available IRF. 

    (chatter = 2) [integer] 
    This parameter fixes the output verbosity: no screen output (0),
    nominal screen output (2), maximum verbosity (4). 
    
    (clobber = yes) [boolean]        
    If true, an existing file of the same name will be overwritten.
    
    (debug = no) [boolean]         
    Activate debugging mode. When debug is "no", all exceptions that are not
    caught and handled by individual tool-specific code are caught by
    a top-level exception handler that displays information about the
    exception and then exits. When debug is "yes", such exceptions are
    not caught by the top level code. Instead the tool produces a
    segmentation violation, which is more useful for debugging. When
    debugging mode is enabled, the tool produces more verbose output
    describing any errors or exceptions that are encountered.
    
    (mode = ql) [string]
    Mode of automatic parameters: "h" for batch, "ql" for interactive.


EXAMPLE

    Parameters are passed to gtltcubesun following the FTOOLs model. They can
    be passed by answering from a prompt, as a list in a command line, or by
    editing the parameter file. This allows gtltcubesun to be called from a
    script.
 
    To be prompted for gtltcubesun simply type in the command line: 

> gtsuntemp
Exposure binned in healpix and solar angles[] : expMapSun.fits
Binned exposure[] : expMap.fits
Fits file containing solar intensity profile[solar_profile_v2r0.fits, lunar_profile_v2r0.fits]: solar_profile_v2r0.fits
Counts map file[none] :
Output file name[] : TemplateMap.fits

Size of the Y axis in pixels[] : 360
Image scale (in degrees/pixel)[] : 0.5

First coordinate of image center in degrees (RA or galactic l)[] : 0
Second coordinate of image center in degrees (DEC or galactic b)[] : 0
Rotation angle of image axis, in degrees[] : 0
Projection method e.g. AIT|ARC|CAR|GLS|MER|NCP|SIN|STG|TAN[] : CAR 
Start energy (MeV) of first bin[] : 100
Stop energy (MeV) of last bin[] : 10000

Computing binned TemplateMap....................!

    Note: Once the output exposure FITS file has been generated, it can be 
    viewed with a FITS viewer such as ds9 or fv. It contains a data structure 
    with layers corresponding to the number of bins specified. 

    The previous example can also be run in the command line as follows:

> gtsuntemp avgexp=expMapSun.fits expsun=expMap.fits sunprof=solar_profile_v2r0.fits \
  cmap=none nxpix=720 nypix=360 binsz=0.5 coordsys=GAL xref=0 yref=0 axisrot=0 proj=CAR \
  emin=100 emax=100000 enumbins=10 outfile=TemplateMap.fits
