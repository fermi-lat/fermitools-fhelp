NAME

	gtburst - Interactive LAT and/or GBM tool to download, extract and analyze GRB or Solar flare source and background spectra.

USAGE 

        gtburst

DESCRIPTION

	With this interactive GUI tool you can download Fermi LAT and/or GBM
	data for GRBs, Solar Flares or other short transient events then
	extract source and background spectra. You can then perform
	interactive foward-folding spectral analysis through internal calls to
	XSPEC. XSPEC compatible files can also be exported for subsequent use
	with gtburst, XSPEC or RMFIT. It also offers capabilites for
	likelihood analysis and observation simulation with standard LAT data.

	The software is internally documented and does not follow the ftools
    	protocals as do the other Fermi Science Tools.

	To initiate a session just type "gtburst" at the unix command line
	prompt.
