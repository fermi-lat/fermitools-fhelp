DESCRIPTION

    This tool creates exposure maps that are needed to compute the
    predicted number of photons within a given Region-of-Interest
    (ROI) for diffuse components in your source model.  They are used
    only for unbinned likelihood analysis.  They differ significantly
    from conventional exposure maps, which are the integrals of
    effective area over time. The exposure calculation used in
    unbinned likelihood analysis consists of an integral of the total
    response (effective area times energy dispersion times point
    spread function) over the entire ROI.  See the gtlike help
    for more details regarding the likelihood analysis.
    
    The LAT point spread function is relatively broad at low
    energies. At 100 MeV, 68% of the counts will lie within 3.5
    degrees of the source (see
    http://www-glast.slac.stanford.edu/software/IS/glast_lat_performance.htm),
    As a consequence, the PSF tails of nearby point sources and
    diffuse components will overlap significantly with the emission
    from your sources of interest. To fit your sources accurately, the
    user will therefore also need to model simultaneously the nearby point
    sources and diffuse components; and this will typically require a
    ROI, centered on your sources, that is several times the
    characteristic PSF size in order to have sufficient data to
    constrain all of the components in your model.
    
    The source model should include any sources that can contribute
    significantly to the ROI, and again because of the size of the
    PSF, this implies a "Source Region", centered on the ROI, with a
    radius that is larger than the ROI radius by several PSF length
    scales.  For example, when fitting a single point source, a ROI
    with a radius of 10 degrees and a Source Region radius of 20
    degrees would be appropriate.  Note that since the size of the LAT
    PSF goes roughly as E^{-0.8}, if the user is considering only higher
    energy photons, e.g., > 1 GeV, smaller ROI and Source Region radii
    of just a few degrees may be used.
    
    All of the sources in the Source Region should be included in the
    source model file that is input to gtlike (see the gtlike and
    ModelEditor help).  The positions and spectral models of these
    sources can either be obtained from a catalog or via a source 
    detection step.  The diffuse components will typically include 
    the Galactic diffuse emission and an isotropic extragalactic 
    component, but may also include discrete diffuse components such 
    as super-nova remnants or the large magellanic cloud.
    
    The exposure map used in the likelihood analysis must extend over
    the entire Source Region, and it is specific to the ROI. The
    radius of the Source Region is an input to gtexpmap and is given
    by the srcrad parameter (in degrees). The radius of the ROI is set
    when the event data are extracted using the gtselect tool, and
    this information is written to the FITS header of the filtered
    file (see the gtselect help).
    
    Since most analyses will likely consider photon energies
    down to 100 MeV, a Source Region radius that is at least 10 degrees 
    larger than the ROI radius is recommended (a warning message will 
    be prompted if this is not the case when running gtexpmap).
    
    The spatial and energy gridding (nlong, nlat, and nenergies
    parameters) for the Source Region must also be provided in
    gtexpmap. Half-degree pixels are a nominal choice for gtexpmap,
    and that means nlong=120 and nlat=120 if 30 degrees radius was
    chosen for the srcrad parameter.  Smaller pixels should result in
    a more accurate evaluation of the diffuse source fluxes, but they
    will also make the exposure map calculation itself more time
    consuming, scaling roughly with the number of pixels in the map.
    The energy range of the exposure map is determined by the
    selections made with gtselect to produce the filtered event file,
    and that energy range is divided into a number of logarithmically
    spaced bins given by nenergies parameter.  These maps are used to
    integrate the spectra of the diffuse components in order to
    determine the predicted counts from these sources. If the spectra
    of the diffuse components are fairly featureless (i.e., mostly
    power-laws, with no sharp spectral features such as cut-offs or
    spectral lines), then 4 or 5 energy bins per decade are probably
    sufficient.
    
    As input, gtexpmap also needs the livetime spent at each
    inclination angle at every point in the Source Region. This can
    be provided by the livetime cube maps, which have the information
    about the livetime as a function of sky position and off-axis
    angle. These maps could be created by gtltcube (see the gtltcube
    help) or obtained from the FSSC. If the livetime cube file is not
    provided gtexpmap will calculate these livetimes from the
    spacecraft file, but it is nonetheless recommended to pre-compute
    the livetime cubes before running gtexpmap, as doing so from the
    spacecraft file will take a substantial amount of execution time.
    Since gtltcube produces a FITS file covering the entire sky, the
    output of this tool can be used for generating exposure maps for
    ROIs in other parts of the sky that have the same time interval
    selections.  Note that the livetime cube is calculated on a
    spatial healpix grid (HEALPix is an acronym for Hierarchical Equal
    Area isoLatitude Pixelization: http://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov/),
    while the exposure map is calculated on a longitude-latitude grid.


PARAMETERS

    evfile [filename]
         Input event file. This is a FITS file containing the event
         data, typically created with the gtselect tool (see gtselect 
	 help for further explanation).
      
    (evtable) [string]
         Event table extension name. Default is "EVENTS".
    
    
    scfile [filename]
         Spacecraft data file containing information such as the spacecraft
         pointing as a function of time. This file could be generated by
         gtorbsim for simulated observations (see gtorbsim help for further
         explanation) or more commonly it can be obtained from the FSSC
         website. 
     
    (sctable) [string]
         Spacecraft data extension. Default is "SC_DATA".
     
    expcube [filename]
	 FITS file containing livetime as a function of sky position and
	 off-axis angle. This file can be generated by gtltcube or obtained
	 from the FSSC website. See the gtltcube help for further explanation.
	 gtexpmap will integrate the livetimes directly from the
         spacecraft file if no livetime cube file is provided.
    
    outfile [filename]
         Output FITS file name containing the exposure map used in 
         unbinned likelihood analysis.
    
    irfs [string]
	 Instrument response functions. The instrument response (PSF, effective
	 area, energy resolution) is currently a function of energy,
	 inclination angle (the angle between the source and the LAT normal)
	 and photon category. Since the LAT will usually survey the sky, a
	 source will be observed at different inclination angles. Each count
	 will therefore be characterized by a different instrument response
	 function (IRF). The default value "CALDB".
    
     evtype [integer]
   	  The evtype to be used in generating the bacground data. The
   	  default is INDEF which will use the default in the input
   	  file. This can be overridded by entering the desired event
   	  type e.g. 3 for FRONT + BACK events. 

    srcrad [double]
         Radius of source model region (degrees). The center of the source
         region is obtained from the Data Sub-Space DSS keywords defining the
         Region-of-Interest in the event file. Default is "30".
     
    nlong [integer]
         Number of longitude points.  Half-degree pixels are a nominal choice
         for gtexpmap.  That means nlong=120 and nlat=120 (default values) if 
	 30 degrees radius was chosen for the srcrad parameter. This parameter
	 accepts values in the range 2-1000.
     
    nlat [integer]
         Number of latitude points.  Half-degree pixels are a nominal choice
         for gtexpmap.  That means nlong=120 and nlat=120 (default values) if 
	 30 degrees radius was chosen for the srcrad parameter. This parameter
	 accepts values in the range 2-1000.
     
    nenergies [integer]
         The number of energy bands to consider. Minimum and maximum energies
         are obtained from the DSS keywords. The number of energies for the
         grid depends on complexity of the spectra of the diffuse components,
         but 4 to 5 per decade are usually sufficient. This parameter
	 accepts values in the range 2-100, with default being "20".
     
    (submap) [boolean]
         This parameter allows you to compute a submap. Default is "no". 
	 This feature (if "yes") was intended to allow for parallelization of 
	 the gtexpmap computation for a given geometry.  You can set the 
	 application to run in parallel on different regions of the overall 
	 map and then add the resulting FITS image together using standard FTOOLS
         (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/ftools/ftools_menu.html). 
	 The user should be careful to define the submaps so that they do not
         overlap or leave gaps.
    
    (nlongmin) [integer]
         Minimum longitude index for submap. Default is "0".
    
    (nlongmax) [integer]
         Maximum longitude index for submap. Default is "0".
    
    (nlatmin [integer])
         Minimum latitude index for submap. Default is "0".
    
    (nlatmax [integer])
         Maximum latitude index for submap. Default is "0".
    
    (chatter) [integer]  
         This parameter fixes the output verbosity: no screen output (0),
         nominal screen output (2), maximum verbosity (4). Default is "2".

    (clobber) [boolean]
         If true, an existing file of the same name will be overwritten. 
         Default is "yes".
    
    (debug) [boolean]
         Activate debugging mode. Default is "no". When debug is "no", all 
         exceptions that are not caught and
         handled by individual tool-specific code are caught by a top-level
         exception handler that displays information about the exception and
         then exits. When debug is "yes", such exceptions are not caught by the
         top level code. Instead the tool produces a segmentation violation,
         which is more useful for debugging. When debugging mode is enabled,
         the tool produces more verbose output describing any errors or
         exceptions that are encountered.
    
    (gui) [boolean]
         Graphical User Interface (GUI) mode is activated if set to "yes".
         Default is "no".
    
    (mode) [string]
         Mode of automatic parameters: "h" for batch, "ql" for interactive. 
         Default is "ql".
    
    
EXAMPLES
    
    Parameters are passed following the FTOOLs model: They could be passed
    answering from a prompt, as a list in a command line, or by editing
    the parameter file.
     
    To run gtexpmap simply type in the command line: 

> gtexpamp
 
    The parameter values have to be provided. Not all parameter are prompted: 
    some of them are "hidden". To change one of the "hidden" parameter, the 
    user should specify the values in the command line or modify its mode 
    by editing the parameter file. For example, to avoid overwriting the 
    outfile, the following command line has to be typed:
 
> gtxmap clobber=no
 
    An example of how to run gtexpmap is given below: 

> gtexpmap
The exposure maps generated by this tool are meant
to be used for *unbinned* likelihood analysis only.
Do not use them for binned analyses.

Computing the ExposureMap using expCube.fits

    In this case, the source region was selected with gtselect, (see the
    gtselect help) to be 20 degrees, and the ROI was selected as 30
    degrees. The livetime cube was provided (expCube.fits) and
    the exposure map generated has 120 longitude and latitude points, and
    20 energy bins.
 
    The previous example could be also run in the command line as follows:

> gtexpmap evfile=ps1_55d_filtered.fits scfile=spacecraft_data_file.fits
  expcube= expCube.fits outfile=expMap.fits irfs=P7REP_SOURCE_V15
  srcrad=30 nlong=120 nlat=120 nenergies=20
