NAME

    gtpulsardb - Creates, filters, and/or combines pulsar ephemerides
                 database files.

USAGE
    
    gtpulsardb psrdbfile outfile filter psrname tstart tstop solareph

DESCRIPTION

    This tool is a utility for manipulating and accessing databases
    containing pulsar ephemeris data. Using this tool, one can accept
    input from any number of FITS files in the Fermi D4 format, and/or
    simple text files containing pulsar data. These input pulsar
    ephemerides can be filtered by pulsar name and other criteria, and
    the results stored in a new Fermi D4 FITS file.

PARAMETERS

psrdbfile [file name]
    Name of input file containing ephemerides (See PULSAR EPHEMERIS
    DATABASE FILE). Multiple files may be combined by listing them in
    a text file, one per line, and supplying the list file name
    preceded by an @ sign. If psrdbfile is NONE (case-insensitive), no
    ephemeris is loaded from a file.

outfile [file name] 
    Name of output file, which will be in Fermi D4 FITS format.

filter = NONE [enumerated string (NAME|TIME|SOLAREPH|NONE)]
    Type of filtering to be performed. If filter is NAME, the pulsar
    name (see psrname parameter) will be used to select only
    ephemerides for the named pulsar. If filter is TIME, the
    parameters tstart and tstop will be used to filter the
    ephemerides based on that time range. If filter is SOLAREPH, only
    ephemerides that match the solareph parameter will be selected.
    If filter is NONE, no filtering will be performed.

psrname = ANY [string]
    Name of the pulsar, used to select only ephemerides valid for a
    particular pulsar. This only has effect when the filter parameter
    is NAME.

tstart = 0. [double]
    Time used for the beginning of the interval used for time
    filtering. This only has effect when the filter parameter is
    TIME.

tstop = 1.e5 [double]
    Time used for the end of the interval used for time filtering.
    This only has effect when the filter parameter is TIME.

solareph = JPL DE405 [enumerated string (JPL DE200|JPL DE405)]
    Solar system ephemeris used to filter the ephemerides. This only
    has effect when the filter parameter is SOLAREPH.

author = Anonymous User [string]
    Name of person responsible for generation of the database being
    compiled.  The name will be recorded in AUTHOR header keyword of
    the primary extension of the output ephemeris database file.  The
    value is intended to help identify the created file, together
    with DATE header keyword value, which is the file creation time
    of the output ephemeris database file which the application
    automatically computes.  Also, it appears in the creation history
    recorded in HISTORY header keywords of the primary extension of
    the output ephemeris database file, in order to help trace back
    originating ephemeris data.

(leapsecfile = DEFAULT) [file name]
    Name of the file containing the name of the leap second table, in
    OGIP-compliant leap second table format. If leapsecfile is the
    string DEFAULT, the default leap-second file (leapsec.fits),
    which is distributed with the extFiles package, will be used.

(chatter = 2) [integer, min=0, max=4]
    This parameter fixes the output verbosity: no screen output (0),
    nominal screen output (2), maximum verbosity (4).

(clobber = yes) [boolean]
    Overwrite or do not overwrite existing output files.

(debug = no) [boolean]
    Activate debugging mode. When debug is "no", all exceptions that
    are not caught and handled by individual tool-specific code are
    caught by a top-level exception handler that displays information
    about the exception and then exits. When debug is "yes", such
    exceptions are not caught by the top level code. Instead the tool
    produces a segmentation violation, which is more useful for
    debugging. When debugging mode is enabled, the tool produces more
    verbose output describing any errors or exceptions that are
    encountered.

(gui = no) [boolean]
    Graphical user Interface (GUI) mode activated if "yes" is
    specified.

(mode = ql) [string]
    Mode of automatic parameters.

EXAMPLES

    In the following example, the tool filters an ephemerides file to
    extract only ephemerides for a particular pulsar as follows:

        > gtpulsardb psrdbfile=bogus_pulsardb.fits \
            outfile=bogus_pulsardb_Crab.fits filter=NAME psrname=Crab \
            author="John Doe"

    The name supplied in the example was simply "Crab", but in general
    the "B-name" or "J-name" may be used as well as common names such
    as "Crab" or "Vela". Colloquial names and B-names are looked up
    using the ALTERNATIVE_NAMES extension to obtain the correct
    J-name, which is then used to look up ephemerides in the
    SPIN_PARAMETERS and/or ORBITAL_PARAMETERS.

    In order to merge two or more ephemerides files, it is necessary
    to supply more than one file name through the psrdbfile
    parameter. This is done using the "at-file" syntax familiar to
    Ftools users, in which the file names are written into a text
    file, and that text file is supplied to gtpulsardb with a
    prepended at-sign (@).

        > edit filename_list.txt
          (List all files to be merged together in the order of merger)

	> gtpulsardb psrdbfile="@filename_list.txt" \
            outfile=bogus_pulsardb_appended.fits filter=NONE \
            author="John Doe"

PULSAR EPHEMERIS DATABASE FILE

    A pulsar ephemeris database file is a FITS file or a text file in
    a Fermi-specific format, and contains a set of pulsar ephemerides
    to be used in a temporal analysis of Fermi data. When so
    specified, the pulsar analysis tools in Fermi Science Tools load
    pulsar ephemerides from pulsar ephemeris database files, and use
    them in their tasks.  A pulsar ephemeris database file can be
    created, filtered, and combined by the gtpulsardb tool. Also,
    pulsar ephemerides for the Fermi LAT pulsars and timing models
    associated with various Fermi publications are available at the
    following web page.
